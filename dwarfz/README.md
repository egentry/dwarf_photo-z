# Where to Start

## Getting Data
### COSMOS
I've included a version of the COSMOS catalog in this repo (`data/COSMOS_reference.sqlite`).

### HSC
Unfortunately the HSC dataset is too large to fit as a single file in this directory (and the exact feature set that I want to include is still in flux). So for now you'll have to download it using `data/get_data.ipynb`
